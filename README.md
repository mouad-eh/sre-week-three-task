To address the toil in the ticketing system and mitigate issues such as recurring obsolete alerts and lack of prioritization, several potential solutions or products can be considered:
### Incident Management and Alerting Tools
Solutions like PagerDuty, OpsGenie, or VictorOps can help streamline the alert management process and prioritize incidents based on severity and impact.
### Automated Incident Response
Tools like Rundeck, Ansible, or AWS Systems Manager can automate common remediation actions for known issues, reducing the need for manual intervention.
### Event Correlation and Analysis
Solutions like Splunk, ELK Stack, or Sumo Logic can perform log analysis, event correlation, and anomaly detection.
### Ticketing System Enhancements
Upgrading or migrating to a more robust and feature-rich ticketing system, such as ServiceNow, Jira Service Management, or Freshservice, can provide better alert management, prioritization, and automation capabilities.
### Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence
Implementing machine learning models or AI-based solutions can help identify patterns, predict potential incidents, and suggest appropriate actions or prioritization.
### Process Optimization and Training
Conducting an in-depth analysis of existing processes, workflows, and tooling can help identify inefficiencies and areas for improvement.
